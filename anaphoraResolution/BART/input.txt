I purchased this watch in March 2010 for casual wear. The watch looks great, but has an unusual feature in that the date does not reset at 31, but continues up to 39 - a minor but monthly annoyance.Today, I dropped the watch when putting it on - it fell from counter height. When it hit the tile floor, nearly all of the numbers broke off and are now floating inside the face of the watch. I guess you get what you pay for, but the $60 Timex I am wearing at the moment has never lost its numbers.I would recommend looking elsewhere.
